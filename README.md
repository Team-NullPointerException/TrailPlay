# TrailPlay
Our game, TrailPlay, brings you an exciting way to stay healthy and have fun at the same time!

We created a mobile application for iPhones which allows you to exercise in your neighborhood to collect points and become the TrailPlay champion. It is important to stay healthy, so make sure to stay away from ghosts shown on the map to keep your streak! You can set your exercise route and collect points as you go! You can compete against the whole world, or create a group among your family to compete against them as well!

# Features

## Exercise to Gain Points
To create your path, simply long press on the map to add a waypoint. As you plot your path, the app will automatically generate coins for you to collect. As you walk your path, you will pick up coins to add to your score. The longer our path is, the more points you get!

## Stay Away from Ghosts
However, if you get within dangerous distance to a ghost, the app will show "TOO CLOSE" on the top and will vibrate rapidly, indicating you to stay away. While you are close to a ghost, you will start losing points so you want to get away from the ghost as fast as possible. If you start to get close to a ghost, the app will warn you by saying "CAUTION".

## Compete and Climb the Ranks
Compete with the rest of the players on the app! The leaderboard shows the points of all the other players all across the game. Walk more, collect more points, and rise up the leaderboard! This leaderboard is also featured on the homepage of the website.

## Add Family Members
You can play alongside with your family! Adding your family members is as simple as scanning your family member's QR code and you are good to go! By adding your family members, you can see their rank and scores so you can compete with them as well. Plus, you won't lose points when you are next to them.
